ðŸ”‘ Key Discussion Points
	1.	Scope of Phase 1
	â€¢	Focus only on application-level vulnerabilities (Java upgrades, removal of flagged JAR files).
	â€¢	UNIX vulnerabilities are out of scope for this release but will be addressed in future phases.
	2.	Current Workflow Overview
	â€¢	Vulnerabilities detected via RTV/CTV notifications.
	â€¢	Team receives extracts (Excel sheet) with vulnerability details.
	â€¢	Each vulnerability has a Vulnerability ID (VID) which is checked in the internal portal (Cyber Insights / Automation Portal).
	â€¢	Additional tracking/reporting through Tableau dashboards.
	3.	Prioritization Strategy
	â€¢	Critical (P1) vulnerabilities are always treated as highest priority.
	â€¢	High â†’ Medium â†’ Low order is followed.
	â€¢	Fix dates drive urgency; past-due vulnerabilities must be remediated immediately.
	4.	Remediation Process Examples
	â€¢	Java upgrades â†’ Download and apply the supported version, ensure compatibility with application.
	â€¢	Removal of unused/flagged JAR files â†’ Locate path and delete unnecessary files.
	â€¢	Other languages (Node.js, Python) and OS-level vulnerabilities fall under different teamsâ€™ ownership.
	5.	Tools & Platforms Used
	â€¢	Internal Vulnerability Portal â†’ Search by VID for details.
	â€¢	Tableau Dashboard â†’ Summary view of vulnerabilities.
	â€¢	Excel extracts shared with application teams.
	6.	Action Items & Next Steps
	â€¢	Nandini to provide an updated Excel extract including a new column with remediation steps for already-resolved vulnerabilities.
	â€¢	You to connect with Bahar and other contacts for backend details on how vulnerabilities are sourced into the portal.
	â€¢	Focus agent workflow design on application-level remediation steps (Java upgrades & file removals) for Phase 1.

âœ… Highlights:
	â€¢	Phase 1 = application vulnerabilities only.
	â€¢	Workflow clarified (Excel â†’ Portal â†’ Tableau â†’ Remediation).
	â€¢	Criticality determines remediation order.
	â€¢	Next deliverable: Excel with remediation steps from Nandini.
