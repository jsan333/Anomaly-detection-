Hi ,

I wanted to share a major enhancement we’ve introduced into the Shire AVM platform that fundamentally strengthens governance, transparency, and operational safety as we scale: the new Plan Review & Validation step.

This feature introduces an explicit, auditable human-in-the-loop approval gate before any remediation action is executed. Once the Planner Agent generates the remediation blueprint (plan.json), Shire now surfaces a “Review, Validate, or Modify” bar directly in the chat interface.
Users can:
	•	Examine the full remediation plan
	•	Request revisions or clarifications
	•	Validate commands and dependencies
	•	Provide rejection notes or risk flags
	•	Explicitly approve the execution

Only after approval does the Patching Agent proceed.

This enhancement directly addresses our need for accountability, clarity, and secure automation, especially as Shire expands toward production-aligned and business-critical systems. It ensures that nothing runs blindly; every change is visible, validated, and intentionally approved.

Why This Is a Step-Function Improvement for Shire

1. Stronger Governance & Risk Control
Every approval becomes a recorded event with user identity, timestamp, and plan version — providing a clean, audit-ready trail that aligns with RBC’s internal security and compliance expectations.

2. Full Transparency Into Agent Actions
Users see the exact commands that will be executed, eliminating ambiguity and giving full clarity into what Shire intends to do before it acts.

3. Safety Layer for Automation at Scale
As Shire begins to manage larger workloads, cross-application dependencies, and production-sensitive hosts, this approval gate serves as a critical safeguard.

4. Unlocks Intelligent Future Capabilities
The validation feedback becomes structured data that the system can learn from over time:
	•	Which plans get approved immediately
	•	Which require changes
	•	What patterns trigger risk concerns
	•	Differences across environments
	•	Preferred remediation sequences

This positions Shire to evolve into a self-optimizing, policy-aligned remediation engine, improving accuracy and reducing manual review effort as adoption grows.

5. Increased Trust & Adoption Across Stakeholders
By giving security teams, SMEs, and application owners a clear approval checkpoint, we reinforce Shire as a safe and controlled automation framework — which is essential for broad rollout.
