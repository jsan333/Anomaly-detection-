1. Is this a customized platform built specifically for a particular customer? How productized is this?

The Shire AVR platform is built as a modular, productized framework designed to be customized at deployment for specific enterprise environments.
	•	The core agentic framework (Analyzer, Patcher, Validator, and Coordinator Agents) is productized and reusable across clients.
	•	Integrations (e.g., ServiceNow/Jira for ticketing, Cosmos DB/Neo4j for GraphDB, and cloud scanners like Qualys/Tenable) are configurable adapters.
	•	For RBC, we implemented a custom integration layer to map vulnerabilities (CVEs) to applications, packages, and systems using GraphDB relationships.
Hence, while the workflow logic and orchestration are reusable, connectors and guardrail thresholds are customized per client.

2. There was a mention that Discovery data has to be stored in the Storage DB to get agents operating post that. Can Discovery be also done via agents?

Yes — the next iteration supports Discovery as an agentic service.
	•	The Discovery Agent automatically scans asset inventories, configurations, and CVE reports directly from integrated scanners or cloud APIs.
	•	The Storage DB (Cosmos DB / GraphDB) acts as a knowledge graph rather than a static store — allowing relationship-driven insights (e.g., CVE → Package → Host → App → Service → Business Line).
	•	This reduces dependency on manual data staging and enables end-to-end automation from discovery to remediation.

In the current MVP, the Discovery data is loaded once from the existing security scanners. The Discovery Agent is part of Phase 2.

3. The guardrails – there seem to be a few places where there is human intervention. Can it be decreased?

Yes, the human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is configurable and can be reduced progressively:
	•	Guardrails ensure risk-validated automation (e.g., validating dependencies before patch deployment).
	•	Using policy-based AI guardrails, we can automate low-risk remediation (patches with zero dependency impact).
	•	For critical or multi-system impacts, we maintain optional approver checkpoints in Jira/ServiceNow.
	•	As the graph intelligence matures, HITL can be reduced by ~70% without compromising safety.

4. The NETS team is not big/equipped enough to be able to run and maintain – hence expect product-like support.

The AVR platform is being structured as a managed AI service, not a one-off deployment.
	•	Centralized orchestration on Databricks and Azure Functions minimizes operational overhead.
	•	Dashboard and alerting modules provide self-serve visibility for the NETS team.
	•	We plan to include a support runbook and SLA-based managed support model (L2/L3) for ongoing assistance — similar to a product maintenance model.
	•	Post-MVP, the support can be scaled via a “AVR Ops Portal” that monitors agent performance, patch success rates, and system health.

5. When can the UI be ready?

The AVR Dashboard UI (built using React + Flask backend) is in development as part of MVP+ (November release).
	•	The initial version will visualize vulnerability status, patch progress, and agent actions (Analyzer → Patcher → Validator).
	•	Phase 2 UI (targeted for Q1 2026) will include impact graphs (blast radius visualization from GraphDB) and integrated ticket tracking.
	•	We can share a preview demo by early November once GraphDB visualization and agent orchestration are connected to the live data pipeline.
